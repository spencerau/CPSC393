### Work Split:
We spent all of our time working on the project together, in person,
mostly huddled around the computer. Even though that meant one person
could only be physically at a time whenever we ran into issues or bugs
we would all brainstorm and bounce ideas off each other. Since we all
contributed equally to the project we should get equal marks for the
group work portion. At times we would finish meetings and essentially
give each other deliverables for the next time we worked on the project
such as debug this problem or have a plan, or develop the architecture
of the LSTM but that was also split evenly since we didn't want to
overload anybody with the project falling during the second wave of
midterms and finals.
